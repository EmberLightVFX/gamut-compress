# GamutCompress
is a tool to compress out of gamut rgb color values back into gamut.

## Context
Out of gamut colors can ocurr with modern digital cinema cameras. If using the camera manufacturer's color pipeline there would be no issue. However with color management pipelines like the [Academy Color Encoding System](https://www.oscars.org/science-technology/sci-tech-projects/aces), there is a working colorspace into which all source imagery is transformed using an IDT or Input Device Transform. 

In the case of ACES this working colorspace is ACEScg. The ACEScg gamut is smaller than most digital cinema camera gamuts. Because of this, when the IDT is applied, highly saturated colors can go out of gamut. Usually when this happens, one of the RGB components is a high value, and one or more of the other components are negative values.

If cameras were colorimetric devices that satisfied the [Luther condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristimulus_colorimeter), there would be no problem. But, because this is not the case, most cameras will hapilly generate RGB tristimulus values that lie outside of the spectral locus. This is possible because the spectral locus represents the bounds of color perceivable by the spectral response curves of the human eye. A digital cinema camera's sensor has spectral response curves that are not the same!

These out of gamut colors most often ocurr with highly saturated light sources like police lights, neon lights, or lasers.

Above is a contactsheet of [sample images](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u6z2a0jboo4vno8/AAB-10qcflhpr0C5LWhs7Kq4a?dl=0) from the [Gamut Mapping ACES Virtual Working Group](https://community.acescentral.com/c/aces-development-acesnext/vwg-aces-gamut-mapping-working-group/80). For more info on the working group check out the [working group proposal](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5hz8e07ydx0d2bm/ACES_Gamut_Mapping_Working_Group_Proposal_Approved.pdf).

On the left are the original images with the ACES Rec.709 RRT display rendering transform applied. On the right are the same images, but with gamut compression applied.

If the display rendering transform does not elegantly handle out of gamut colors, artifacts such as those seen above can occur. The negative values in scene-linear of these out of gamut colors can pose issues for image processing as well.

Compressing these out of gamut colors back into gamut is useful for pleasing color reproduction, and for reducing issues in VFX compositing and DI.
